#Purpose: takes in Amino Acid Count Data and calculates the Observed over Expected Frequency (expected, as based on NNK)
#         to create the Observed/Expected Frequency Plot of Amino Acids
#         Additional Plots:
#         Frequency of Nucleic Acids at each Position
#         Frequency of Positions for each Amino Acid
#Changes across Experiments: please alter on parameters.txt
# 1. Location of Mutagenesis
# 2. Mutagenesis for 5 Amino Acids
